This is a simple web application written in Dart, using Flutter framework.

There are several notable parts:

- the articles in the blog are written as simple markdown, these are rendered using 3rd party flutter_markdown package.
- icons for e.g., LinkedIn, or GitHub are taken from the 3rd party package icons_flutter.
- web app responsiveness have been achieved with the help of MediaQuery, but also the 3rd party package sizer.
